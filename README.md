The Bank Report Analysis Dashboard is a data analysis project that uses Python and Power BI to study and visualize banking data. In this project, raw data was cleaned and processed using Pandas and NumPy in Python, and visual insights were created using Power BI. The dashboard displays key information like total deposits, withdrawals, customer growth, and transaction trends with the help of DAX measures and interactive charts. The main aim is to help understand banking performance and customer behavior through clear visuals and easy-to-read metrics. This project shows skills in data cleaning, data visualization, DAX calculations, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to turn raw banking data into meaningful business insights.
